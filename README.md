Simple Video Player

This is a simple video/media player in Java, that can play MP3 and MP4 files.

This repo has two folders. The first one was for testing purposes, where I had set a default video to be played.

The second folder contains the actual project where. before playing any default video, the users will be asked to select their desired video to be played

More improvements coming soon!!
